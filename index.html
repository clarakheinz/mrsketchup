            <p>Hi there, I'm Clara Heinz and I like to create things. Building interesting things did not come across my radar until I had an epiphany. In my market research based role, the best part was building the report. Piecing together intriguing visualizations with strategic conclusions was the main thing I found myself look forward to. And then I stumblwed across programming for the analytics side of my job...and then I found ways to create on the web. It's really spiraled from there. My obsession to learn more about software development has continued and I hope to make the transition into doing this day to day. I built this website to host my experience, projects, and interesting tidbits about myself. I hope you enjoy it!</p>
